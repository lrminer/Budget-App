## Idea
Our application is a new take on financial analysis. The purpose of the application is to allow users to compare their budgets to other the budgets of other users.  
  
Asking others how they spend their money can be uncomfortable. This application allows its users to make query requests to a database of stored budgets in order to see how those demographics spend their money.  
  
The application allows users to compare their budgets side by side to the average of all the responses for any given query.
